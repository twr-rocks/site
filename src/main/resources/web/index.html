            A software product designed to enhance the consumption of Apache Kafka topics,
            providing guaranteed ordering at the key level, rather than just the partition.
            This allows consumers to retry in the case of failures, without either losing the order (e.g. by sending to
            a dead letter topic),
            or blocking other records in the partition with different keys.
            Whether or not to guarantee ordering can be set per record.
            It additionally supports delayed delivery, backoff during retries and time-to-live per record.
            This allows you to build scalable concurrent self-healing systems, while still fulfilling ordering requirements as necessary.

                Distributed software architectures allow improvements in availability and scalability
                but suffer from network partitions and that leads to a whole list of associated problem, e.g.
                <a href='https://www.maxant.ch/2021/05/24/1621878436189/' target="_blank">Eleven Patterns, Problems & Solutions related to Microservices and in particular Distributed Architectures</a>.
                A pattern often applied to solve global data consistency requirements, is the
                <a href='https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html' target="_blank">transactional outbox pattern</a>
                where instead of sending events outside of the transaction used to commit data in a source component,
                an outbox table is committed to, within the same
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID" target="_blank">ACID transaction</a>.
                The contents of that outbox table are processed asynchronously, resulting in
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency" target="_blank">eventual consistency</a>.
                That pattern has been implemented in many libraries and software products, as well as in the cloud.
                Most frequently, the outbox is used to send (domain) events to downstream services. However,
                it is also possible to make the source component respond to the event itself, execute some logic,
                like making a call to a downstream REST based service, sending an email, or integrating
                anything else that does not have a event based API.
            </p>
            <div class="alert alert-secondary justify" role="alert">
                <!-- style="color: red; font-size:50px;" -->
                <i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>

                It is also possible to use things like
                <a href='https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect' target="_blank">Kafka Connect</a>
                to consume events from a topic and make calls to REST-based services, send emails, etc. Sometimes it is preferred to
                keep such logic in the main application, perhaps because after successfully calling a REST-based service,
                a subsequent step needs to be carried out, or state in the database needs to be updated, e.g. for auditing purposes.
            </div>
            <p>
                Regardless of how it is used, little is written about consuming from the outbox and
                <i>what happens when failures during the processing of the events, occur</i>. Strongly
                related to those failures is the ordering of the events. For example an error while processing
                the first event in the outbox can lead to a second event overtaking the first one. Sometimes,
                that is not good, and complicates understanding what happened.
            </p><p>
                When working with a monolithic architecture, understanding problems in the software is often
                greatly simplfied in comparison to those problems described above for distributed architectures.
                This is because the process steps are often serialised, especially when considering just a single
                instance of an "aggregate", like an insurance case, a shopping cart, etc.
                While not always advantageous, required or even necessary, such serialisation,
                can greatly simplify the problem at hand. In certain cases, not processing events in the correct order
                can lead to globally inconsistent data, a.k.a. corrupt data.
            </p>
            <p class="bold">
                This software product acts as middleware, sitting between the transactional outbox
                and your software which processes the events sent via the outbox. It takes care of serialising
                the processing of events <i>for any given business key (aka <code>aggregateId</code>)</i>, allowing
                the processing to be attempted multiple times in cases of failure (using automated retries),
                effectively holding back other events for the same key, which must be processed later, in order.
                Note that not all events must be blocked (it is configurable per event).
                <br>
                <br>
                This software product is not solely dependent upon a transactional outbox and can also be used
                in cases where your software simply needs to consume Kafka records, but with the same advantages
                described above or in the <a href="javascript:scrollToElement('#features')">feature list</a>.

                1) Your application saves data to the database. In the same transaction used for saving its own business data,
                it also saves any tasks that still need to be done, e.g. making a call to a downstream service using REST,
                or sending an email, or mapping some state before sending it out as a domain event<sup>*</sup>. Indeed, any resource outside
                of your application that needs to be bound into the transaction should be included by adding a task to the
                outbox.

            <div class="alert alert-secondary justify" role="alert">
                <i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                Sometimes it is preferred to have mapping logic in the main application
                rather than in Debezium or Kafka Connect.
            </div>
            </p><p>

                2) Debezium (or your favourite CDC equivalent) uses change data capture (CDC) mechanisms like tailing the database
                transaction log, to consume the changes to the database and create an internal model of them.
            </p><p>
                3) Once the transaction is committed, Debezium puts the outbox tasks into a "raw" Kafka topic. Note that if you
                are simply publishing domain events, you are free to use something like
                <a href='https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/transformations/outbox-event-router.html' target="_blank">Debezium outbox event router</a>.
                TWR can be useful on the other side, when consuming those events, where ordering is necessary but failures could occur
                while processing them - see 4b below.
                It is also possible to fill the raw topic using periodic polling (which you must implement as TWR does not connect
                to databases), so long as the messages are sorted first. TWR also deduplicates messages from the raw topic.
            </p><p>
                4) TWR reads those raw messages and converts them into a standard model that it uses. This involves investigating
                the current and previous state, as well as understanding if the data was inserted, updated or deleted.
                As an alternative, TWR can be used to consume externally produced events and map them into it's standard model
                (think "inbox" rather than outbox), so that if your application fails to execute a task the first time it consumes
                such a message, it will be triggered again, to attempt it later, allowing messages for other <code>aggregateId</code>s to
                continue to be processed, while only blocking other messages for the same <code>aggregateId</code>, so that order is maintained,
                if that is required. Another application of TWR in this sense is when joining messages of several topics, but when a different
                part of the final model has not yet arrived, and you want to wait for it, so that e.g. you can use a foreign key constraint in your
                database model.
            </p><p>
                5) TWR publishes the tasks to an output topic. It ensures that where you require an ordering guarantee, tasks
                are only published if all preceding ones have been successfully completed. It can also delay tasks, if
                you require that. It can remove tasks if a time-to-live which is set by you has been exceeded. Importantly,
                it partitions by <code>aggregateId</code>, so other data having other keys is not blocked should a certain message
                fail and need to be retried (as is the norm when using plain Kafka). Thanks to that, tasks can be retried with
                an exponential backoff, or halted entirely until an administrator intervenes, without interupting the processing
                of other business aggregates. All of these mechanisms lead to a self-healing system, but also one which is simpler
                to understand, because while it is asynchronous, concurrent and scalable, you can limit the concurrency for a
                single aggregate. Note that while normally we strive for concurrency in order to scale, we want to reduce the
                chaos that that can bring with it when business processes running on single aggregates run in parallel.
            </p><p>
                6) Your application consumes the messages with the help of a TWR library, and executes the business logic
                associated aggregate type using the aggregate as the input. If the execution is successful, the outbox table is
                updated and the completed timestamp is set, which signals TWR to remove that task from its model (via flows 1-4),
                and output the next task for that <code>aggregateId</code> (via flows 5 & 6). If the execution fails, you can set the
                time to wait until, on the task in the outbox, which TWR uses to wait for, allowing for exponential backoff,
                which can be useful in allowing downstream services to recover if they are struggling under load.
            </p>

                <li><b>Backoff During Failure</b> - If a standard Kafka consumer faces a problem while processing a
                    record, and ordering is paramount, it cannot simply discard the record or push it to a dead letter
                    topic, without at the very least sending any further records <i>with the same key</i>,
                    or perhaps all records of that partition, to the dead letter topic. It gets tricky and expensive
                    to ensure that no data is lost and ordering is maintained. Another solution is to shutdown the consumer
                    and restart it later. This forces unnecessary rebalancing of the partitions amongst surviving consumers
                    and causes entire partitions to be blocked. And it requires that you program such a backoff strategy.
                    <br>
                    A standard solution should exist, but
                    doesn't. Hence the requirement for TWR to handle failure with diverse backoff strategies, seamlessly
                    with only the need for simple configuration.
                </li>
                <li><b>Blocking At the Key Level</b> - If a Kafka consumer is stopped or paused as part of a backoff
                    strategy, then all the records in the partition containing the record with the failure, are blocked
                    with it. TWR should be able to partition based on the record key, so that records with other keys
                    can be allowed through without being blocked.

                In 2018 we developed a basic outbox pattern which used the database as its source. The proof of concept
                can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/maxant/commands-demo" target="_blank">https://github.com/maxant/commands-demo</a>.
                We soon learned two things. First of all, guaranteeing order, when faced with failures is very hard.
                Second, the design doesn't work well under load when the outbox contains a lot of tasks.

                    Messages must be sent to the message broker in the order they were sent by the service.
                    This ordering must be preserved across multiple service instances that update the same aggregate.

            </div>
            <p>
                So ordering, is very important.
                And we learned that the hard way with incidents reported in production that small amounts of data
                were globally inconsistent even though all pending outbox tasks were processed. The cases where we
                found inconsistencies were thanks to us having the data replicated once using an audit trail and
                once using the source data. Our assumption is that there are other inconsistencies in the landscape
                which we know nothing about!
                The easiest, cheapest and most reliable way to get ordering is to use
                a "message relay" based on CDC (Change Data Capture), just like it is described on microservices.io,
                namely using a product like <a href="https://debezium.io/documentation/" target="_blank">Debezium</a>.
            </p>

                <b>Design Choice #1</b>
                TWR is based on CDC so that messages are sent to the message broker in the order they were sent by the service.
                Debezium is the default CDC implementation which TWR supports.
            </div>
            <p>
                One of the main requirements that this product fulfils is exponential backoff while processing failed
                messages. We could store failed messages in a database, but we have the problem of how to get them out
                of the database and back into the component, in the correct order. When multiple instances of a component
                are running concurrently, we then have contention issues and the experiences we had back in 2018, trying to
                solve those problems, while maintaining order, led us to make the next design choice, namely to based TWR
                on Kafka.
            </p>
            <div class="alert alert-primary justify" role="alert">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-info-circle"></i>
                <b>Design Choice #2</b>
                TWR is based on Kafka, because with <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/" target="_blank">Kafka Streams</a>
                we have all the constructs necessary to build waiting room functionality, which lies at the core off
                all of the requirements that we fulfil.
            </div>

            <p>
                The next design choice was to separate writing into the outbox, and processing from the outbox.
                In our original implementation from 2018, we used the outbox primarly for processing the intention
                to call REST services during orchestration, to write data, after committing our own local creates/updates/deletes.
                This led to a design whereby our components were the actual subscribers of the outbox, because they had the knowledge
                of how to make these REST calls.
                In the mean time, it might be more customary to decouple the architecture more and simply send out events.
                As a result, we decided that it makes more sense to split the two concerns, so that writing to the outbox
                and later processing from the outbox (regardless of whether the source component or a downstream component
                is consuming), are separate single responsibilities.
                This was partially influenced by the description of the outbox pattern on microservices.io which only talks
                about sending messages/events, and partly
                based on the ability of Debezium to publish domain events directly using SMTs or more simply
                using <a href="https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/2.3/transformations/outbox-event-router.html" target="_blank">their outbox pattern</a>.
                Next, came the following article: <a href="https://softwaremill.com/microservices-101/" target="_blank">https://softwaremill.com/microservices-101/</a>
                which talks about an inbox and using it for deduplication. Here too, the production and consumption of outbox tasks is separated.
            </p>
            <div class="alert alert-primary justify" role="alert">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-info-circle"></i>
                <b>Design Choice #3</b>
                TWR supports the writing and processing of outbox tasks, but using two different sets of APIs and libraries.
            </div>
            <p>
                Since it is the responsibility of the message relay to process data from the transaction log and push it
                into Kafka, it must also handle failure and retries. Debezium does this very well.
                Hence it is only on the consumer side, while processing the events out of the outbox, where components
                may require the functionality provided by TWR, e.g. retries with (exponential) backoff, administration
                of "poison pills", blocking of only single aggregate IDs, etc.
            </p>
            <div class="alert alert-primary justify" role="alert">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-info-circle"></i>
                <b>Design Choice #4</b>
                The majority of the features provided by TWR are implemented on the consumer side.
